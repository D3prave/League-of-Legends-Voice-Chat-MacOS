# League-of-Legends-Voice-Chat-MacOS

This app will fix the Voice Chat issue on the MacOS version of League of Legends executable.

The executable shell script that opens League of Legends.app via Termial which forces a permission request for access to the microphone by LoL app.
To run it you have to open lol.sh with terminal.
At the moment this is the only solution and it is only like 3 lines of code.
Just run the app (you must have league and riot client not open already).

Remember that you have to run League by this app every time (when you want to be able to use League of Legends Voice Chat).
Make sure that you have League of Legends installed in the default path: /Applications/League of Legends.app.

Enjoy!
